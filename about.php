<p> My name is Jacob Cole. I am a Computer Science major, with a concentration in network security.<br> 
	I am currently a senior, and I am set to graduate in Winter 2024. When I am not in school, I work for <br>
	the IT department in the college of engineering. One of my goals in life is to get a software development<br>
	 job in the aerospace industry. When I am not at school at work, I am at home playing with my two golden doodles.
